Yet all the details, especially combined with the speed, often appear to me as a blur. It might be nostalgia but there's a part of me that liked the simplicity, legibility and the iconic aspect of the original Doom's graphics. Of course Doom needed a graphics update but this style seems so busy to me, with detail upon detail, like Michael Bay's Transformers.

Doom isn't the only such game. I find many AAA games seem to have a lot of detail on screen to the point that I have difficulty reading it, my eyes strain and I often just let my eyes get out of focus. I'm playing in 1080p, is it less of a problem in 1440p or 4k?"

The world's are large, a ton of stuff goes on, and even on low settings, the models still look pretty. I had played the game since day one on my OG Xbox One, and many have claimed that if I could run 2016 on my PC (which I can) I can run Eternal. Boy was that sorta wrong.

I can play the game pretty much fine if I set every graphics option to low or off, close every program except for Steam, and use some commands and launch options, I can have it work. Sure, places like the start of the Doom Hunter base tank the FPS at times, but it's *playable* after doing some tinkering. 

Battlemode also works **at times**. I played one match smoothly (I lost as Slayer), but I was playing as a Revenant with a Marauder and the game was 2-2, but my game had crashed during the final rohnd and now I feel awful because I can't contact my teammate to apologize.

My specs are a GTX 950 GPU, Intel i5-4440 processor, and 16GB of RAM. I think the guys at id should really add more graphics settings such as toggling bloom, bullet decals, and very low qualities. Anyone else in a similar boat?"

Why, if sam transformed to his robot form to guide humanity, did he let thousands die on mars for argent? Why would he trap the slayer at the end to try to continue his research and profit as head of the UAC, if his main goal was to work with the slayer to defeat hell.

Today i bought the ps4 version of doom 2 and its so fun. Kinda scary atomsphere, groofy music and very simple yet super satisfying gunplay. I never played serious sam but watched videos about it and its a tad like it when 50 enemies rush at you and you have to kill them all fast or you die. 

Ofc it has huge levels and you need to Explore for Heath, ammo and keycards and the gunplay is super simple. But it's the madness i see in serious sam combined with brilliant level- and enemy design and super Fluid controls, even on ps4! I played for only 4 hours so far and can already outmove my enemies by sprinting around them while still hitting my target.

I like doom eternal (i only played Doom 2016 a bit) but it's a tad too linear for my tastes and the ''''puzzles''' in it are 'bro hit 382883 Switches in this room and u can go in the next room'.

as somebody who largely plays games purely for narrative, coming into doom, i knew i had to approach in a way i usually don't approach games. the doom games are not narrative-driven games, they thrive off of the gameplay experience. i knew this before i even began playing. in fact, the only thing you really need to know about doom's story is that a portal to hell has opened on mars and you're the only person capable of closing it. that's really all the game offers you in the story department. part of me did wonder how we got into this position in the first place, how the world of doom evolved so exponentially to have mars inhabitable, or how we got our hands on such advanced technology, but that isn't what doom is about. no, doom would sooner rather give me an explosive shotgun than an explanation. instead of immersing you into the lore, doom throws you right into the action of ripping the heads off of demons over a rock soundtrack. there is high energy and adrenaline pushing you throughout the entire experience as you blast, punch, and dismember your way into hell, stopping this madness for good.

&#x200B;

overall, i thought the game looked and felt good as i progressed through my 13ish hour playthrough. this installment of doom does a good job of maintaining the modern visuals, while also delivering on that comforting classic feeling. again, i haven't played the original doom games and likely will not play them, but even so, i have heard and seen so many things from those games, enough to take notice of the nods and nudges 2016 makes to those veteran doom players. from the more subtle references like the map layout, to the more obvious moments like certain demon encounters, to the incredibly satisfying feeling of equipping the coveted BFG and using it for the first time. all things a veteran doom player will no doubt pick up on and feel joyous over.

&#x200B;

when you're not knee-deep in blood and guts, you're traversing the multi-layered map layouts present throughout the game, which was easily the biggest downfall of the game for me. don't get me wrong, the brief moments you get to yourself between enemy encounters are always moments i adored, but i would have adored them a lot more if i didn't have to traverse through multiple, poorly configured jumping puzzles. it didn't help that the doom guy's mobility is staggered by his large stature. even when mobility is upgraded later into the game and you gain the ability to double jump, i thought that doom guy didn't move as fast as he probably should have. this is also coming from a player who always plays games in their highest sensitivity settings, with doom being no exception there. the whole traversal mechanic in the game was so poorly done, in fact, that the only times i ever died throughout my playthrough was from missed jumps. there was not a single death which took place from a demon or any sort of enemy encounter, nope, they all occurred from me falling off of the map. granted, i was playing on the easiest difficulty so that probably doesn't say much anyway.

&#x200B;

like i mentioned earlier, i play games primarily for their narrative. give me a deep story, a world full of lore, characters i'll love, characters i'll despise, and some sort of conflict that draws all of those aspects together, then i'm in for a treat! something like a silent protagonist would usually be a baffling idea to me and would contribute to an overall poor experience. however, i knew i couldn't approach doom with that same mindset. in doom, you play as a protagonist who is simply named ""doom guy"". he is a silent protagonist and you never even get a single grunt out of him. that's right, this protagonist jumps into a portal leading to hell, chainsaws the heads of all the demons within, and makes his way back to the surface of mars without even a single audible breath. usually, i'd be upset about this, but doom guy isn't here to be relatable or funny or lovable. doom guy probably doesn't even care what you think. doom guy solves all his issues by punching, kicking, or shooting them, and you're going to be okay with that. you'd assume that doom guy is just another soulless protagonist based off all this, right? wrong.

&#x200B;

sure, doom guy is a silent protagonist, but from his actions, his personality truly shines. during a specific cinematic in the game, doom guy is receiving instructions on carefully disconnecting and removing an object of great scientific value. the person on the other side emphasizes how valuable this object is. so what does doom guy do about that? he kicks the object off of its power supply, of course! the person giving doom guy instructions is left baffled at his carelessness, and this was the one cinematic in the game where i thought doom guy's personality was clearly showcased. doom guy might be a silent protagonist, but his actions say a million words, and he's definitely not as soulless as you'd initially think just by reading this.

&#x200B;

in conclusion, doom (2016) kept me entertained for the entirety of my playthrough, while i blasted my way through hell on mars. the fast-paced and highly chaotic nature of doom did an excellent job of keeping me hooked and excited for the next encounter, especially with the humorous overlay coated onto the game. the wide variety in arsenal also allowed for each encounter to be approached uniquely, so facing off against demons never got old. it is unfortunate, however, that before getting to that next encounter, i was constantly left uncomfortably traversing the game world. all in all, doom (2016) leaves me ecstatic to eventually experience the highly successful follow-up, doom: eternal. hopefully, i won't be 4 years late to that one too."

At the end of another level I went to fast travel back to the beginning to complete a missed event and for some reason it took me to the end level screen so I missed that. Had an enemy get stuck behind a wall and couldn't complete a challenge due to it. Event XP and Slayer XP not being rewarded at the end of mission screen. 

This game feels so polished all around that it feels shitty to have these things happen.

1. Demon vs Demon mode 
(Similar to Battlemode but you and another player go against each other as the playable demons, you can summon demons and there would be an outline to indicate if it’s your summoned demon or not) 

2. Survival mode 
(You and up to 8 players fight off demons within waves, each wave gets more and more difficult, starts off with fodders and then goes all the way up to Marauders, Arcvilles and Tryants, maybe even the Buff Totem as well)

I just got trough the main story, and I plan on going trought Doom 2016, then Eternal Again on Nightmare while reading the lore than and then the first DLC.

I noticed that on the Steam store the Bundle's got a significant discount. I'm tempted to get it on PC but heres the catch. I have a potato PC. More specificly my CPU is trash bein an AMD Athlon X4 750K, and my other parts being decent (Nvidia GTX 1060 3GB, 8GB RAM). Now I tried out the game via family share on the lowest settings and it ran ok in the most parts but additionally every time I got into a fight the music battle music didn't start and the sound effects stuttered. I could also try to lower the settings via console commands but I don't know if its worth greatly decresing the visuals just so i can play with K&M becuase the look of the game adds so much to the experience. I'm also doing well and getting better with the controller but I feel that the gameplay can't get faster at one point.

I might have better controlls on PC but does it worth over for basically everything? I might get a better PC half a year latter and I'm not sure if it'd be wise to get it now on PC with these conditions. I'd also like to play Battlemode but I don't know how populated or balanced the matchmaking is it on PS.

&#x200B;

TL;DRI have game on PS4 and I don't know if its worth getting on PC on a low end PC.Is Battlemode on PS alive and well?"

Like, just at the start where the scientist turns into a zombie at the beginning of the hell invasion, the Doom 3 Marine is replaced by the Doom Slayer? Or where he just portals in by mistake just after the invasion starts, somewhere else on the base?

You'd have access to the Doom 3 weapons, and go Slayer on the Doom 3 demons' asses in a massive power trip, and pretty much subvert the horror aspect of the game.

PDA required to unlock a door? Nah, he just punches through it.

It'd be cool if a lot of the cut demons, like the Doom 3 Mastermind, would appear to be slayed, too.

Hell Knight the big badass demons? Yeah, they're nothing compared to the twenty Barons the Slayer just tore in half in hell ten minutes ago.

All the while Betreuger is freaking the fuck out about this unknown element butchering his way through Mars City, and why his bosses are proverbially shitting themselves.

They could even tie parts of it back to '16 and Eternal by having the Ancient Martian City as Hebeth and the Soul Cube as makyr/Night Sentinel technology.

I'd so pay $30.00 to replay a ported and modified Doom 3 as the Slayer."

For my own sanity, I just have to stop it, I *suck* at this game, even though I played it for idk how many hours and know all the common tricks.

If I really want to UN this shit, I would easily need (several) hundred hours of practice and more game knowledge. Whatever strategy I established in this game, it is just not working on Nightmare and I would need to completely reassess my gameplay, maybe rebind keys and really fucking study this shit like some sort of school subject. 

But is it worth it, to invest so much time in a Single Player game?  Get gud? Where do you draw the line? 

# I am just gonna accept it, Doom won.

I usually don't suck at FPS games. But Doom on Nightmare/UN is really just next fucking level. And it's not even the DLC! I feel like a complete scrub who never actually played a real FPS game before.

I hope I’m not the first one to say they don’t feel “Doom” at all, almost like they’re ripped off some other basic fantasy RPG kind of game. Doom is a cyberpunk blood magic fantasy and I’ve always loved it for that consistent over-the-top style, whether it dips into more horror themes in Doom 3 or sci-fi in 2016, it’s always felt like Doom—until the ‘creative’ decision to add all these eyeball themed enemies. It just feels out of place and lazy, and I didn’t think much of it until I wasted an hour trying to beat that boring and overly difficult “eyeball inside a cube” boss at the end of the blood swamps level. 
One, that boss is PAINFUL unless someone tips you to use the ballista instead of the in-game recommended chain gun, and the fact that it throws hell knights and pinkies at you left and right instead of powerful fodder was an idiot decision;
Two, it’s the third enemy I can think of with this “big floating and glowing eyeball” style. If it was the first, then sure, I’d be fine with it, but the THIRD? We’ve already fought that brain thing in Necrovol (can’t remember its name) and mowed through countless of those annoying turrets in the DLC, so to have the second eyeball boss and second eyeball enemy introduced makes it feel like the creative team is running out of cards. I can’t remember any eyeball like this in the original Dooms or 3, it sure as hell doesn’t match the style of 2016, and I can’t remember any in-game explanation as to why there’s so many of them.
I would have still found it painful, but I think I would have enjoyed the boss in hindsight a lot more if it just had a Doom-themed design. Like a meaty lattice holding the cube open with a ghostly lost soul themed head in the center, or a mechanical sentient puzzle-like cube covered in satanic scripture, not a fucking 👁 and nothing else. I finished the boss, and unlike finishing the buff-totem marauder where I thought “yeah, it was a challenge but it was fun”, I’m left unsatisfying and still just as angry at the boss as I was in the middle of fighting it even though I beat it already. (and the same goes for turrets. even though I hate the Major drones for the exact same reasons, I can at least appreciate that theyre something new instead of some cheap environmental enemy they slapped in the middle of an arena to be “ruthless”)

Anyway, I’m not typically one to complain over something so trivial and I’m aware I sound super privileged, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there in case some developer sees it. I love Eternal and how faithful it is to my nostalgia, but these eyes, man, they just feel wrong and, simply, lazy."

Since I couldn't really find any comparable metrics online, I'll ask the community now: How is your performance regarding framerate during the Ancient Gods DLC? Specifically on UAC Atlantica, I've seen mine drop to 60 in some areas.

To help draw a comparison: I'm on a Ryzen 7 2700x, GTX 1080ti and 16GB of 3600Mhz RAM and play at 3440x1440p. Additionally I use Carmack's Eternal Reshade, in case anyone else has experience with it. Changing the visual settings doesn't seem to make a significant difference really, at least not as much as expected, 10-15 fps at most.  I don't use chromatic aberration, motion blur, depth of field, etc.

Thanks in advance for any help you could give. In case someone needs additional information, just say the word."

Bought Doom 2016 day one, but it took me three tries over the years until committed to finish the game which was last year. Can't say I loved it, can't say I didn't liked it. It was pretty normal, OK-ish. I won't have the need ever to replay it. One playthrough was enough.

Now I am in a mood again to have a short burst of some FPS game so I am looking at Eternal on sale. Heard mixed things about it and saw different reviews, that it is harder, there is some unnecessary platforming involved and such things. But overall people lean towards the opinion that Eternal is much better than Doom 2016.

My question is by how much better ? If it's equal quality wise or just slightly improvements here and there then I am going to pass. If it's way better than the 2016 Doom then I am going to jump in and try it out. Please note, that I do not care about the story in the slightest. I have no idea what was going on in 2016 either story wise. I just want to shoot some stuff.

I recently purchased the standerd version of Doom Eternal about a month ago and have been having a blast!  
As of today there was a sale on the deluxe edition and i had just about enough to purchase it as i wanted the extra skins and features plus the Ancient one dlc.

Unfortunately when at checkout it told me i couldn't purchase it as i owed the standerd version already.

Am i just doomed and cant purchase it at all now or is there a work around of some sorts.  
(Using Steam btw)

Thanks!"

After playing both Doom 2016 and Eternal, I’ve gotta say that the Super Shotgun is my favourite weapon in both games. Thought it would be cool if in the next game, the super shotgun had two different mods, one being the variation from 2016 ( Being that bullets pierce through enemies, each shot consumes one shell and you can use two shots before reloading) and the meat hook from Eternal being the other. I think it would be cool because of the severe reduction in ammo from Eternal, you would have an option to consume less ammo at the cost of the meat hook’s mobility."

\- I already sent ticket to Bethesda asking for help, and tried everything they suggest - showing them proof of purchase, my dxdiag, msinfo32 and Bethesda Report, verify the game, reinstall the game with and without the DLC, uninstall antivirus, disable firewall, update DirectX, reinstalling Steam, doing selective startup with only Microsoft services, and no result. After doing all these without result, Bethesda disappeared on me - the last response I received from them was November 4th.

\- Searching around, I tried to start with the game's exe, using NVIDIA GeForce Experience, GOG,... but still no luck.

Since I ""played"" the DLC for nearly 10 hours and the DLC have been in my account for more than a month, refunding it to my friend is not an option. Can someone tell me what I can do to try solving the problem? I'm desperated."

The dosbox version is still accessible though you have to choose it each time. I run my steam games from folder shortcuts and not from the steam itself (i use bat files to do that) so when i try to open doom it launches the new default version and not the dosbox version, the batch file simply is like this:

    start steam://rungameid/2280

is there a way to launch it with dosbox version instead of the new one?"

Yes, everyone saw it coming, I know. But in my opinion, what made Samuel such a great character in the first place was him being human.  


Samuel was established at first as a flawed thinker. He was someone who truly intended a better future for humanity and dedicated himself to his work for that future. He was willing to cross boundaries if it meant it’d help humanity in the long run; and it was his determination that helped him even be who he is; an intellectual philanthophist, chairman of the UAC and founder of the Samuel Hayden Foundation. It was becasue he pushed boundaries that he even discovered argent energy and figured out a way for humanity to benefit from it. But ultimately, it was his lapse in judgement with argent energy that almost ended up bringing humanity’s downfall. It was a human error. That was why I liked his character so much; he was, from the right perspective, a represantation of humanity; with all our successes and failures being reflected onto his character. No one is truly evil intentionally; afterall.   
 

For that reason, I feel as if making him this otherworldly being who already had this knowledge stripped him of his humanity; and damaged his character. He was no longer Samuel Hayden; The man who gave himself up and did the impossible for the betterment of mankind, He was Samur Maykr; a seraph who was simply tasked with helping humanity for his own world’s benefit.   


Now, I'm no lore expert, I probably missed a lot of important details while forming this opinion. If you have any counter-arguments please let me know. I still love Doom Eternal, I just feel like they did Samuel wrong with this twist."

This list will rank all enemies by their danger to the player on Veteran skill. Factors taken into consideration include how frequently the monster appears, it’s speed, health, damage, and range. This is just my opinion, so I would love to hear your own ranking. Enjoy :)





F Tier: Not a threat


28. Morgue Zombie: Only appears in one level of Doom 3. He is easily killed by either the Shotgun or the Machine Gun. Even though he is faster than a Normal Zombie, he is no tougher and only appears once in the whole series, making him a laughable threat.


27. Biosuit Zombie: A group of these appear in only one area of Resurrection of Evil and The Lost Mission. Very similar to the common Zombie in terms of speed and health. However, you are intended to run around with a Chaingun in their appearance in ROE, so they will be annihilated easily. In The Lost Mission, they are in an large outdoor area while you hold very powerful weaponry, so they aren’t threatening in the least.


26. Boney/Hell Zombie: Similar to the Biosuit Zombie in terms of their numbers and health, they appear in only one level in each of the campaigns. However, these are slightly faster and come out of dark enclaves. These zombies are barely a threat, but they could actually injure you if you’re careless.




D Tier: Rarely dangerous


25. Fat Zombie: Easily the slowest of the Zombies, waddling towards you instead of walking. This makes him a very easy target, killed by the Shotgun with ease. His marginally higher health than Normal Zombies does not make him a greater threat due to his speed. He appears somewhat frequently early in the game, hiding in dark corners to swing at players, but is generally more of a nuisance than anything else. He appears rarely later in the game, but isn’t a threat at all due to your powerful weapons. 


24. Tick: A large swarm appears only one time in the Doom 3 Delta Complex. Very similar to Trites in behavior and can overwhelm you, as many will attack in unison. However, they can be killed easily due to their spawn locations being distanced from you and in a straight line.


23. Flaming Zombie: Stronger, faster, and more durable than most other Zombies. They can surprise unprepared players if they are unaware of how they spawn, and close distance at a rapid rate. However, they are extremely rare, and once you know how they spawn, they aren’t much of a threat. In The Lost Mission, they appear in Hell more often, but feel free to gib them from medium range with the Rocket Launcher.



C Tier: Somewhat dangerous


22. Normal Zombie: Very common enemy for the earlier levels of all 3 campaigns. They aren’t very powerful or fast, but can travel in packs and use the element of surprise. They punish you often if you don’t use your flashlight, often placed in dark corners or into traps which surprise the player. 1 on 1, however, they are simple to kill and are generally more of a nuisance.


21. Chainsaw Zombie: Fast moving and can deal a lot of damage. He is also surprisingly durable, able to survive a shotgun blast to the chest and still charge at you. However, they are mercifully rare, only appearing in the DOOM 3 campaign, and sporadically at that. 


20. Wraith: Very agile demon who rapidly advances on your position and sometimes spawns in groups. They often appear alongside other demons to surprise the player, so do not underestimate them. However, they are the most easily cheesed demon in game due to their teleportation mechanic. While using it, they are locked in place, and even stay vulnerable to damage for a bit after they turn invisible.


19. Pistol Z-Sec: Possesses good battle tactics and a hitscan attack. This makes him a decent threat in early levels when your arsenal is limited. They are less common than their more dangerous squad mates, however, as they have low health and low damage output. He is easily killed by the Machinegun at medium range, and gibbed by the Shotgun at close range.


18. Shield Z-Sec: Crafty fighters that block damage with their shields. They can fight you with relative impunity against bullet weapons such as the Shotgun or Pistol, but they are very weak to explosives such as Grenades. They appear very infrequently, not appearing in ROE and only rarely in the other two campaigns.


17. Pinky Demon: Durable and aggressive, Pinky’s possess a frustrating close range attack that knocks off your aim. Fighting them with weak weapons such as the pistol is challenging due to their speed and aggression. However, you will have powerful weapons for the majority of their encounters, and they are rare in all of the campaigns, making them a minimal threat.


16. Maggot: Quick moving enemy that charges your position. They can change their hit box as they run by standing or crouching, making them hard to hit. They are also somewhat common and can box the player in, as they frequently appear in groups. They have a low amount of health though, making them easily killed if they can’t reach the player in time. 




B Tier: Dangerous 


15. Cacodemon: Possess a powerful and fast ranged attack and like to show up in pairs or groups. They love to rush your position while firing projectiles, and only death will stop them. It doesn’t help that they can be bounced around with weapons like the Plasma Gun, so dealing killing blows is more tricky than expected. They are fearsome, but their slow speed and relatively low health means that they can be taken care of quickly once you master fighting them. The Shotgun and Chaingun are great choices for fighting these meatballs.


14. Trite: Even though these are weak individually, swarms can easily block the players movement and are quite a nuisance. Trites are common, so their tendency to leap at the player is a significant threat, as it is hard to avoid, can throw off your aim and can cause a lot of damage. They are especially dangerous if you’re unfortunate enough to be trapped on multiple sides. They are far more of a threat than people expect, but swarms can be killed with the Machine Gun efficiently, while the Pistol is a good choice for small groups or individuals. They also move rather slow without their leap, so you can funnel them through doorways to kill them and avoid damage entirely.


13. Cherub: Slippery and very aggressive. Their leap attack is almost impossible to dodge, gives almost no warning, and does significant damage. Not only do Cherubs appear in groups, they like to accompany Mancubi as well, making a terrifying combo. They have low health, thankfully, and their speed without leaping is rather slow. Avoid using the Shotgun against them, as their leap attack can throw off your aim, so rapid fire weapons such as the Plasma Gun and Machine Gun are great options.


12. Lost Soul/Forgotten One: Very fast and can charge at you from any angle in the air. Their small size and group tactics makes them difficult to hit, and they can swarm your position very quickly. They are also very common in many levels, meaning you have to deal with their antics often. They can quickly melt your health if your aim is off or you aren’t quick on the draw. Luckily, they have minuscule health, and the Machinegun kills them very efficiently.


11. Machinegun Z-Sec: Rapid fire hitscan and smart AI make these common zombies dangerous in a variety of situations. Not only can they pepper you with a heavy stream of bullets from behind cover, they also like to tag team you with Shotgun Z-Secs. Their stream of damage is significant in close range as well, so do not underestimate them. They have rather low health, but their threat level is still high due to their dangerous attack and their frequency of appearance. Do not stand in front of them if you want to live. The Machine Gun is the best overall weapon against them, but lobbing Grenades at their chosen cover is also a great option.



A Tier: Considerable Threat


10. Shotgun Z-Sec: Easily the most dreaded enemy in the beginning levels of Doom 3. They are very common, and their shotgun attack is unavoidable and very damaging. They are also intelligent fighters, using cover and sidestepping to dodge attacks. On Veteran skill, a point blank shot on you can easily take 1/4 of your health away in one shot, making them absolutely devastating. Although their damage tapers at longer ranges, it is still unavoidable, and is made even more threatening as they tag team with Machinegun Z-Secs. They even join forces with Commando Zombies in The Lost Mission, making them even more dangerous. Never stand in the open while fighting them or you will be gunned down with impunity. The Machinegun is the best weapon against them, as it is able to kill them at a range where they deal minimal damage.


9. Imp: The most common enemy in Doom 3. You can enter almost any area and hear them spawn in droves, and they will cause a sizable percentage of your damage in any given play-through. Even though they are comparatively easy to deal with 1 on 1 than some other demons, they are still formidable, possessing a projectile with splash damage and a hard to avoid leap. Imps love to spawn in pairs or small groups accompanied by more powerful monsters, making them even more of a threat. Not learning how to deal with them is suicide, as you will encounter them 15-30x more than other demons.


8. Vulgar: Replace Imps as the most common enemy in ROE. They are stouter, more durable and more agile than them. They also have an incredibly irritating leap attack that is very similar to the Cherub. They are much more erratic than Imps in combat, having very small delays between attacks, giving you only a brief window to dodge leaps or fireballs. Because of their ornery nature and frequency of appearance, they will cause a lot of damage to you until you become adept at fighting them, and thus should be a high value target, even with stronger monsters around.



S Tier: Very dangerous enemies


7. Revenant: High health, decent damage and hard to dodge projectiles make this demon a devastating foe. Although they are somewhat uncommon in Doom 3 and The Lost Mission, they are everywhere in ROE, constantly spawning in new areas, sometimes in packs. The Plasma Gun is a great weapon to use against them, blowing up their rockets before they can reach you. Most other weapons are far weaker against them, however, and if you fail to blow up their rockets, they are relentless and can chase you for a long time before they explode. If that wasn’t enough, their melee attack is very damaging and severely limits your ability to fight them at close range. Brutal enemy to fight against, stay on guard constantly when they’re around.


6. Chaingun Commando: A Machinegun Z-Sec on steroids. Far tougher and more damaging than their zombie counterparts, they use cover constantly and will lay down withering fire. They tag team with Tentacle Commandos to great effect, keeping you occupied at close range with their buddy while they run up to you and open fire. NEVER, I repeat NEVER attempt to fight them at close range with the Shotgun, as  they will deal massive damage and can survive multiple shells. Blast them with the Rocket Launcher at long range to eradicate them, as their head will be slightly visible when they take cover.


5. Tentacle Commando: The assassin of the demonic horde. Very common in the second half of all 3 campaigns, they will constantly sneak up behind you and deal heavy damage. They are lightning fast, aggressive, and possess decent health. Their tentacle attack and kicking will annihilate you if you don’t master crouch fighting. Easily the most dangerous common enemy, they will always test you, no matter how long you’ve been playing Doom 3. 



SS Tier: Deadly

4. Mancubus: A powerful brute with the highest health of any non-boss enemy. Their fireball launchers and melee attacks will decimate you, and they can withstand a ridiculous amount of punishment. Thankfully, they are sluggishly slow and rather rare, so you can fight them very effectively if you’re smart. But if you encounter them unprepared, be prepared for the fight of your life, as they are force to be reckoned with. Using anything weaker than the Chaingun is not recommended, but Grenades and the Rocket Launcher also perform well if you lack Ammo Belts.


3. Hell Knight: The gladiatorial beast of choice for Betruger’s army. They will appear more often than other powerful monsters in the late levels of all 3 campaigns, and will test your skills constantly. They have high health, a powerful projectile, and a melee attack that can practically one hit kill the player. Luckily, they are slow movers, and are the perfect target for the Soulcube or Chaingun. However, slip up once while fighting them and they will kill you. 


2. Bruiser: ID Software decided to make the brother of the Mancubi far more dangerous for ROE and The Lost Mission. Not only do his fireball launchers have a faster rate of fire than his bulkier relative, but he is significantly faster and more aggressive. If you stand in front of a Bruiser for longer than 3 seconds you’re going to end up dead. The screen on his face is a weak point, but good luck hitting it, as he will never stop firing at you if you’re in his line of sight.  They are very dangerous in the Lost Mission, appearing almost exclusively in cramped hallways or rooms. Use the Artifact or BFG when they they spawn to spell a quick end for these monstrosities, truly a terrifying monster.


1. Archvile: The priest of hell, the absolute pinnacle of danger for normal demons. Their ability to spawn other monsters to assault the player is ridiculously oppressive, of which they can spawn a high variety. Although they have less health than the other high tier monsters, it does not matter in the slightest when they decide to spawn Commandos or Hell Knights. Even when weaker enemies are spawned, it is still very dangerous. They also possess devastating flame attacks which are hard to avoid and will melt your health, as well as powerful claws which do high damage at close range. Immediately use the BFG or Soulcube/Artifact upon seeing them, as leaving them alive is a recipe for certain death."

I get fucked because I can't get ammo because I chainsaw at a zombie... but it gives me the ""NO TARGET"" prompt. I'm not too close, not too far, and he's pretty centered. And other times the chainsaw locks onto a *different* zombie from the one I'm trying to hit - a different zombie who is *way* off center. It conditions the player badly! It conditions the player to expect a chainsaw lock at certain ranges, but the inconsistency is horrible. 

The same thing with blood punch -- I'll waste a BP because it doesn't glory kill properly. 

The same thing with glory kills, in general. The demon will be bright orange, and I'll hit my button for the glory kill, and it just punches aimlessly -- several times -- then finally it just uses a blood punch on some fodder and kills the monster I was trying to get the glory kill on. 

Anyway... you get the point, and I'm sure you've all dealt with it. 

Id Software - you've *got* to deal with this. The game is ambitious and, when it works, it's great. But when it flops, it's just frustrating because there's nothing the player can do about it. 

I can deal with difficulty, because the player should just ""git gud"" -- but when the bugs are so frequent, there doesn't seem to be anything we can do."

Last time I played Battlemode was on my Windows 7 system. I recently upgraded to Windows 10 with all of my game installs still on the original HDD on the new system. I use PdaNet to tether my phone's wifi. Reason I mention is because Rockstar completely dicked me over for using PdaNet, and I wanna make sure all avenues are explored to figure out the issue. Please and thank you. I have screenshots I can provide but I don't know how to share them without deleting the text post."

I honestly have loved him from the start and he is incredibly fun to fight which makes him one of my favourite enemy types. I remember when some people would try to say that he was unfair and it ""Goes against the flow"" of combat even though he always matched the flow of combat in the sense that when playing Doom, the 'Flow' of combat usually consists of these areas:

1. Fast Traversal
2. Fast Movement
3. Fast Killing
4. Resource Management
5. Understanding the Arena

The Marauder literally supports all of these elements, just because he 'demands' your attention has never meant that he doesn't fit in with the combat. I think the videos by Under the Mayo talks about this really well in his ""Defence of Marauders."" I personally could not agree more and I think he does a really good job of shutting down all those people who moaned about his design, including so called Game Journos and Youtuber's who were quick to judge his design. I also love how UTM examines how people who criticised the tutorial didn't analyse it properly. It never says ""Stand at mid range"" it says ""Keep him at mid range"" which is different as explained in the video. I find one of the most confusing aspects of criticism came from how he is basically sold as a demonic version of the Doom Slayer, so in that case he should be incredibly deadly and everything about his design will MAKE you a better player. Finally, I do want to say that I can imagine that this community along with the vast majority of Doom fans probably enjoy his inclusion and I'm sure we can remember the Archville from Doom II and how deadly he could be. So this isn't aimed at this community as a whole as I'm sure we love the challenge. But I wanted to add some context as it has beena while. So, I'm intrigued whether you think the Marauder is a good enemy type? Please vote and as always remember to be respectful in the comments. 

VOTE AWAY! ✌ 

I HIGHLY reccomend you watch the videos on his design if you haven't seen them as it really goes in depth as to why the Marauder is a great addition.

The map ambient sound effect (it's not part of the music according the game settings) will sometimes keep on playing after I close the map and will play over the game sound/music when I resume, and will even keep playing when I exit to the main menu. While this isn't a game breaking bug or anything (and it seems to stop playing after a few minutes) it's still fairly annoying, and it almost makes me nervous to hit the tab key.

This bug has already been reported by other people during the last months, but since these threads are quickly buried under low effort memes and reposts it's hard to tell if this is experienced by most players or just a minority.

Not only is the only game in just about 10 years I've been able to actually *enjoy* more than one playthrough of, it's the only game ever that I've listened to the soundtrack of while not playing. Hell, it's the only game who's songs I know the actual names of.

What I mean to say in all totality is that they've nailed not only the atmosphere down, but Doom Eternal is just so confident in what it is and what it wants to do that it's beyond enjoyable; it's an experience.

How in the hell does ID follow a game like Doom Eternal? I can't see many adjustments that could be made that would improve the experience aside from things like new demons and maybe starting the campaign with dash (like how you start Eternal with double jump). I can honestly just see this becoming a service type game where new content is continuously released, and the masterpiece is able to be honed over and over again.

Honestly, this is the first game where I wouldn't mind that being the case. I suppose in the end I'm just worried about a potential sequel fucking with the formula and losing the magic that Doom Eternal has found.

&#x200B;

Edit: To clarify, my being totally cool with this becoming a ""service type game"" relies on the current system still being in place. No microtransactions of any kind, new series' to unlock, and relatively substantive DLC continuing to be released. Just wanted to clarify."

Thank you all."

So I don’t know if most players are aware of the bug in UN that makes it so when you spawn into whatever level you left off at with no ammo, no gun, no dash, And you can’t even punch It makes the game unplayable, and the first time this happened to me I had just finished doom hunter base and wanted to call it a night. So having beaten UN before I knew the game will only save after you finish the level, so I press esc. In the rewards menu, it gives me the prompt that it will only save the level after completion of the level which I had done. The next day I hop back on to see how far I will get when to my surprise I lack almost all motor function and weaponry. 
Do the Devs know about this issue?
Is anything being done? 
that was the first time of many times that this has happened and I don’t know if this has been brought up before.
Does anyone know a fix to this because I’m doing what the game is telling me to do.

698,Doom,Revisiting my Doom Eternal Wishlist from 2018,3,3,jzo6i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/jzo6i6/revisiting_my_doom_eternal_wishlist_from_2018/,9,1606187517.0,"Back in April 2018 [I made a wishlist of all the things I hoped to see and not to see in a DOOM 2016 sequel,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/8e6nu4/with_the_rumors_of_a_doom_sequel_announcement/) so I thought it would be fun to take a look back and see if anything was included and if my opinions have changed. Of course these are all my opinions and you are welcome to disagree. :)

###What I hoped to see that didn't happen

* **Non-linear level designs.** Sadly we didn't get this one. Eternal's levels are linear by and large, but they are designed so that the linear path often takes you back to previous locations in the level, a neat design in its own right. While I think Eternal would have benefited from a more nonlinear design, the end result we got was still very fun.
* **Modding**. Modders are able to do some interesting changes like change demon spawns and even use fanmade textures, but we're still a ways away from a true modding experience. They also removed SnapMap. However id has mentioned wanting to support modding in the future, so hopefully it is able to grow in scope.
* **Arena-style multiplayer**. Interestingly they took a step away from this with their unique Battlemode. Met with mixed reception, BM does have its merits but it was ultimately not something most of the community including myself was interested in. It also seems to have eaten up a lot of resources post-launch. I hope for a return to deathmatch in the future.
* **NG+ mode with revised spawns and new secrets, other small changes.** The substitute for this seems to be master levels, but so far there is only one available to those who didn't pre-order. Hopefully more come soon, and in the meantime PC players can enjoy fanmade master levels.
* **PvE (horde mode).** There is a fanmade horde mode but that is PC only, single player, buggy, and restricted to in-game assets. Here's hoping we get an official horde mode with all the bells and whistles at some point.
* **Co-op campaign.** This seems much less feasible given what we know about Eternal's design now, so no hard feelings.

###What I hoped to see that made it in 
* **Hidden rooms filled with enemies and secrets**. Id's solution to this was secret encounters and I love this decision. They're fun, challenging, and optional so you don't feel punished for exploring. Some of the more classic surprise demon encounters are available in the purposefully difficult TAG part 1 as well. I'm glad we got this.
* **Varied level locations and set pieces**. They knocked it out of the park on this one.
* **Improved Plasma Rifle**. Also check. 
* **Color variety.** Doom Eternal is a very, very colorful game. While I like the change, the atmosphere seems to have shifted along with it. Perhaps tweaking the lighting to be darker and adding slightly more contrast could have helped here. It's tough to take a lot of the disturbing imagery seriously when actually playing the game.
* **Improved Plasma Rifle.** Id opted to go back to the classic Plasma Rifle design, and we're all the better for it. Heat Blast works better than ever. We don't talk about the meme beam.

###What changed that I wanted to stay the same
* **Telling a large story with lots of characters and cutscenes.** Id fundamentally changed how they approach story-telling in Eternal, making heavy use of 3rd person cutscenes and opening the story to more than just a few key characters driving the plot. 2016 was subtle where Eternal is (often annoyingly) direct in its narrative and characterizations. Eternal lost some of 2016's uniqueness in this regard, but luckily most cutscenes are skippable and the plot is easily ignored. I can only assume the increase in cutscenes and story-telling was to attract a wider audience.
* **Silent Doom Slayer.** He spoke for about 10 seconds, and it was horrible. Not a big deal.

Now the problem came after I finally beat level 26 of AV and decided to take time off it and play Scythe and then Scythe 2 (both using Doom 2 as base). I completed Scythe and started Scythe 2 and later I was stuck on level 26/27 for so long I decided to start Going Down using TNT as base, so that I could revisit it down the line. Now I did all these with the assumption that as long as I wouldnt touch the other wads, my saves would be....well, safe. I just completed  Going Down though and I decided to revisit AV (on Plutonia) and.....the latest saves I had for them disappeared, and the latest levels I had for them on the save directory was the autosave at the start of Level 25....and if youve played AV, you know how exhausting 25 & 26 are smh. Dreading the same for Scythe 2, I checked it (i.e. the save directory for Doom 2 where its based) and yep- Im back on Level 26 there too.

Is there any way I can prevent my saves from being overwritten? If not, how can I prevent this in the future? Is there a limit to the number of saves GZDoom holds altogether or is it on a wad-to-was basis?

Note: I think this is worth mentioning- Ive turned autosaves on so that the game restarts on the start of each level when I die. I mention this because I have an inkling the number or autosaves may have inadvertently overwritten the AV save Ive lost. If so, is there a way I can maybe directly delete the autosaves I have for levels I dont need to revisit?"

You might already know where im going with this.

Samuel Hayden will fall and becone Lucifer ruler of hell.

Samuel=Samael, Angel of death, Seraphim, Satan,

Seraphim/Hayden was god’s most loyal and powerfull angel and his right hand. Exactly as Lucifer was.

It isnt suprise if you consider that Seraphim was already declared traitor by makyrs, just al Lucifer was.

He already did kinda rebell when he prioritized saving himself over destruction of dark lord.

My first attempt to beat UN was in march, where i was eaten by a Cacodemon in Exultia. Damn that was a long time ago.

In the second attempt I was slashed by Dread Knight in the Super Gore Nest. I was so pissed that I got so far.

In the third attempt, I got crushed by fucking Gladiator because of his random attacks. Whatever.

But in the fourth attempt, Ive managed to beat the game on UN. It was such a good feeling that Ive done it without any cheats. When I beat the first stage of the Icon of Sin, I was left at 5HP and if it werent for the saving throw, i would die to elemental damage, cause the floor was set on fire. At the second stage I was also pretty close to death but I used every last weapon on the Sin and when the cutscene finally played, I was screaming. I just wanted to share it with you guys, you can do it! I can give you tips if you want for any encounter / level. RIP AND TEAR until is it done.

Especially when quick swapping between weapons

It’s absolutely amazing and i really wish it could be implemented into doom eternal because it’s so  insanely fun and there would be more players as doom eternal is the newest one.

But i understand it could cost too much resources and no one really liked it for some reason so they had to release battlemode which is also fantastic but has a shit ton of issues.

People say that you can only achieve the peak gameplay experience of doom eternal with a mouse and keyboard and Im here to tell you thats absolute bullshit. It doesn’t matter what system you use, if you’re fast enough then you can beat anything the game throws at you with ease. 

It’s not entirely a matter of the platform, but a matter of skill. Us console players are extremely underestimated. Just watch SMVR on YouTube. We don’t need a keyboard to quickswap. People who say the weapon wheel slows us down are liars. The only perk that a pc has is higher framerate, which will soon be rectified with the next gen hardware.

Basically I've played about 2 hours and not really liking it so far, and I want to know if it is worth me continuing, based off what I liked about Doom 2016. I of course could read articles but I don't want spoilers incase I decided to keep going. Also, no offence intended - I can see why people love this game, but it just might not be for me.

Basically in Doom 2016 I loved the environment and story. I know some people say Doom 2016 wasn't really lore heavy, but for me I loved learning about mars, humans interaction with it, ardent energy and their relations and studies of hell. I found this riveting and it motivated me to keep finding out more. I also loved how each environment on Mars was super unique and served a functional purpose, both to the story, but also the base itself - going to special stations for special needs.

So far the environments in Doom Eternal i've found really boring and uninteresting - nothing like how I enjoyed exploring every inch of Mars. I dont really like the demonic environments at all either, I don't care so much for Hell. In Doom 2016 they were short and interspaced by Mars, but so far everything I've seen, whether on Earth or not, has a sort of old ruined city vibe with burning pits. I also don't care about the Demon lore in the slightest - I don't have any interests in their hierarchy and system and it does not in any way motivate me to keep playing.

I don't also like how they've changed some of the aspects (e.g. not finding guns naturally on the ground, cutscenes, even seeing Doomguy's face, the explanations of how to use weapons). these things are minor but they totally disrupt the immersion of the game for me, whereas in Doom 2016 I was immersed play for 4 hours straight kinda deal.

What my burning questions were/are is What happened to Samuel hayden, ardent energy? how earth interacted with hell? More sci-fi environments, Demons interacting with Modern cities, lore based around the war and humanitys interaction with hell.

So - do people think it's worth I keep playing, based off what I like?"

I've recently been working on my triumphs for the gold podium, so naturally ive been playing a lot of demon games. Battlemode is a great mode that genuinly is alot of fun to play but I feel it has a few flaws, that namely being the chaingun and the plasma rifle. personally i dont like using them as they feel reallt cheap, for example if youre playing a mancubus all a slayer has to do to wreck you is run up close range and pop the chainguns shield and youre shredded. same goes for the plasma rifle, though to a lesser extent. every game I've played for my mancubus has gone more or less the same, sprayed down by a chain gun or plasma rifle. do other people match up against a lot of these spammy players or am I just remarkably unlucky?"

827,Doom,Help,0,0,jz5umf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/jz5umf/help/,0,1606115779.0,"So I just bought doom (2016) for PC and am having a multitude of issues. First off I am running an MSI GS75 Stealth, 17 8th gen, 16 g ddr4, 2070 rtx maxq, and have the game installed on an external Samsung t5. My computer is more than capable of running most if not all games on high to ultra at 60 FPS (capped by external monitor). So with that out of the way, Issue 1 is that the game stutters. I have it tried to optimize through geforce for performance as well as visuals, both stutter, I turned off razer chroma in doom settings as mentioned in posts from this sub (even though I have no razer peripherals) I have deleted the razer chroma software I previously used for razer products, I tried running the game on low settings, I updated my drivers as well as the latest windows update. None of these work ad the game will still randomly stop every minute or so. 

secondly, the audio cuts out, the main audio like zombies and gunshots sounds fine and works perfectly, but it is secondary audio like doors opening, some dialogue and music that stutter constantly. I have tried everything that is recommended through forums as well as the Bethesda site. I have changed the audio from 4800 to 4400, from 4400 to 4800, updating my drivers, deleting and reinstalling directx, turning off any external audio sources, restarting the game and my pc, made sure no other apps were running while doom is, updating the drivers for my headset (arctis 7) and troubleshooting the audio sources from right clicking the audio icon on windows. 

I don't know if the port is broken for PC or what but it is driving me insane. I just want to play the game but it is impossible to enjoy a game that runs like shit. Any help is appreciated thanks a lot."

I just thought of something I still haven't found an answer for, regarding the update for Eternal from PS4 to PS5.

We all know a patch update will be coming for both next gen consoles sometime in 2021, but what I'm wondering is, if I don't get the current PS4 version and wait for the update patch and buy the PS5 version directly, I'd be getting the PS5 version only, without the PS4 license.

If that's the case, it would be more clever to get the PS4 version between now and a few days before the update is released. That way your PS4 version will be updated and become a PS5 one, while still giving you the right to play it on PS4, should you ever need to, for whatever reason.

Am I missing something or is this right? 

Thanks."

If i prioritize demon players too much the AI will rush and destroy me, but if i pay too much attention to the AI the demon players will take me. It's just so chaotic sometimes. Campaign is chaotic too but i have no problem with it.

Also i can never find fodders to chainsaw for ammo, and those few times that i do, i get loot blocked and it takes ages to find another fodder. All i seem to find are player spawned demons who can't be chainsawed without 3 fuel canisters.

In Master levels or classic mode there should be a lot of challenges in some rooms and also Slayer Gate should be available. For each challenge beat and slayer gate, we should get unlocked weapons.In each level there should be a Demon power bar in UI, cut into two different bars, purple and red. For each secret challenge RED bar should rise giving demons some boosts. The more bar is filled the more demon spawns and when maxed out two buff totem arrive in all fights.If you managed to beat Slayer Gate where it is harder than normal slayer gate with more demons and also One Ghost possesing super heavy, the Purple bar get maxed out and now on the map Ghosts arrive to posses demons.

And at the end of each level there should be like a last hardest encounter. If you have purple bar maxed, Two or Three ghosts posses super heavies. And if you have RED bar maxed two buff totems arrive also. Boss of each level should also get an buff and new attacks.

I think it should be really interesting to unlock new weapons by doing challenges and slayer gates, and by doing them at the same time level get's harder each time you do them.

Also adding Ultra Nightmare difficulty, no extra lifes allowed, if you die it's over, ofcourse not removing your save file. But if you managed to beat it with maxed out Demon power bar, you should get GOLDEN skin for an weapon."

Additionally, while I don't care much for the Cyberdemon, as iconic as it is, I do dig his death-sound, it's just so atmospheric!

Can you guys also explain which one is better and why so that I can have a better understanding?

On the Switch, Doom 2016 is 79.99 and the prices on other platforms are 24.99 in Canada. So I'm a bit skeptical of buying it for 79.99 on the Switch since it costs way cheaper on other platforms. I'm also assuming that when Doom Eternal comes on the switch, it will cost 79.99 so I want to save as much as I can.

I don't have any good pc or laptop to run Doom so it is useless to buy it there, and I don't have a Xbox or Playstation. Also this is limited by at 250.00 CAD Gift Card so I'm trying to get the best of it.

I do know bits about the sarcophagus and the soul cube when trying to figure out how this could all line up. I knew it had to fit somewhere because of the soul cube sitting in doomguys pad, since if he had never seen it there would be no reason to have one in his office. 

Very simple version: doomguy had adventures between 64 and the night sentinels, one of which being on doom 3s mars. 

He is the hero who wielded the soul cube with the ancient martians and was at one point in the sarcophagus shown (or it was made for him, but never used) but returned to hell as he always does. He later was found by the night sentinels as we see in eternal. The reason Hayden says that doomguy is the only human to go to hell and back is simply due to him not knowing of doom 3s marine. This does mean that doom 3 is a separate doomguy though, but that can be rectified by saying that they are the same person over different timelines. We don’t have any firm evidence that doomguy immediately went to the night sentinels after 64, nor do we have any evidence that doomguy didn’t have adventures before being sealed in the sarcophagus if I remember correctly."

Will there be a performance update making the game run better so I can get more frames and will they fix blood punch and chainsaw?

Have they said anything about a timetable for all this or will it all be coming once the next dlc comes out.

I was really looking forward to it as I really liked the demon designs in it, but after The Ancient Gods DLC I don't think it's going to happen. Does anyone else want this?"

They will flash but instead of the swing animation they put up the shield AND the swing hitbox still exists, so I just get hit anyway. So now I can't even shoot them. 

Even if they don't put the shield up while they are in the middle of the swing they don't stagger anymore either. I've died to marauders multiple times in a row to this and I haven't died to one in months except the buff totem one."

981,Doom,Suggestion: Gore-Nests to replay fights,19,19,jylthc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/jylthc/suggestion_gorenests_to_replay_fights/,3,1606033167.0,"The idea is to bring back Gore-Nests to give us the option to replay certain fights in areas that are like arenas.


In Doom2016 we started fights by activating gore nests. In Doom Eternal we should get a similar option to replay certain areas.


For example: Super Gore Nest Level:


right at the beginning when you punch through the wall you get into the arena and you start the fight up until the cutscene with the pinky comes up. Once the Pinky is killed, a Gore-Nest in that area appears. If the Gore-Nest is activated it disappears and the whole Demon spawn cycle that is set up for that area starts to repeat. This way we could keep fighting, learn the arena and get gud. The smashed open door from the pinky would be blocked by those satanic symbol wall. Once you finished the fight again, the Gore-Nest reappears and you can continue endlessly.



This would especially be nice for farming XP for events too.

no checkpoint reloads

no replayling up until you reach the arena again"
