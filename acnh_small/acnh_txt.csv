A combination of me realizing that much of the content I loved from the previous games was missing, repetitive and dull dialogue and the wedding season just simply not beeing fun in the first place made me loose all interest in the game and honestly the entire series.

Now its been quite a few months and updates since that and I just wanted to ask if the game is worth picking up again.

Have atleast some of the essentials been finally added?
Like have the old item sets been finally added back (Robo, Rokoko, and Nintendo sets where my fav)?
Has the house customization been improved?
Have the villager dialogue/""personalities"" received some sort of improvement (I hated how one-dimensionally happy they where)?
Have Gyroids been FINALLY added to the game?
What about Rooster?
Or Tortimers island?
What about all the exotic fruit?
Or the missing clothing?
Maybe an improvement tonthe terraforming tool?

I really hope the updates didn't just add event specific stuff (like halloween furniture) and nothing else, otherwise im really gonna loose hope for this game to become good."

But Grizzly/and/or Curt owned a bar in my downtown area. Sometime in the dream's backstory, I slept outside in a sleeping bag outside of the bar. Made a real mess of it.

Grizzly and Curt, as well as other Villagers kept showing up to my house to tell me to clean my mess up.

I couldn't because my 3DS broke and couldn't access my game, it even corrupted my Switch saves.

Then later on, my Mom was studying the family genealogy, and says that she found a new ancestor in the family. She said a name, that I remember seeing in the basement.

Cue me entering the basement which is a massive labyrinth of antiques, books, chocolate and just outright junk.

I find a sock with the ancestors' name on it. Then the villagers show up.

Hundreds of them, ready to capture me for ruining the downtown area. (It was completely destroyed and on fire at that point) despite I apologized, or at least tried to.

They're chasing me through the basement labyrinth and I even get caught a few times but wiggle out of their grasp (I guess because they don't have fingers)

And the dream mostly ended there.

A series on kid‚Äôs channels or an interactive spinoff on Netflix where you can customize your character, and choose dialogue.

Raymond is the nerd who always geeks out on books and math. Maple would just be the cutesy of the series. Apollo is a retired athlete seeking a relaxing island life. While Bam is the wannabe athlete who longs to be a soccer champion. Roald would just be the dum dum of the series, like Patrick from spongebob. Flora would have her own health service business on the island, and Leif would have his own shop. Blathers is Nook‚Äôs childhood pal, and they used to call themselves cousins to the point where they were convinced they were, by blood. Isabelle was ditched by her parents and left to suffer. (A little too dark for an animal crossing topic I‚Äôm sorry) Nook and Isabelle were close, but not to the extent of Nook & blathers.

Every day is no different from each other. It might of been okay if there were more things to do or a month-season day-20 minutes like Stardew Valley, but no. Every day just feels the same.

2:Villagers
There are a whole lot of villagers and all of them have preset personalities.
Stardew Valley has every character feeling different, but animal crossing has them feeling practically the same.
Villagers feel like the people in a Pok√©mon town but a bit more advanced,

3: Gameplay
Why is there only boring activities like fishing and bug-catching? Why can‚Äôt we go in the mines like in Stardew Valley and kill some monsters???

4:???
There is only chores to do each day. Talk to some villagers, water the flowers, then make some money??? If you miss a day you don‚Äôt get stuff done so it‚Äôs just a labor of having to play every day to get some Nook Miles and some candy? This is stupid.

Conclusion:


Stardew Valley is better
Edit: you guys even read the actual post?? just the conclusion???

I don't have the game yet due to a job loss earlier this year causing a financial crunch, but due to my excitement for it I would just like any tips or direction for when I get it. 

If anyone has any advice for things to avoid doing as maybe a waste of time that would be appreciated!

I asked him and he said yes so I was stoked!

But then this morning when I woke up, there is a house being built for Chevre, and she will be the 10th villager.

So what I want to know is, will Marcel still move in when someone else moves out, or did I lose my chance because the spot happened to fill up before he got here?

I don't want to have missed out on Marcel, so I'm hoping he just sort of waits in stasis until there's room for him to move in?

723,AnimalCrossing,The ability to purchase event DIYs after the event is the best thing in the new ACNH update and I hope they do this for ALL seasons/events going forward.,118,118,k29ee0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/k29ee0/the_ability_to_purchase_event_diys_after_the/,11,1606539042.0,"Basically title. I played Turkey Day yesterday and did ‚Äúearn‚Äù the DIYs in game. But one of my kids didn‚Äôt finish his and he was so relieved  to learn he could buy them from Nooks today. I hope they do this for ALL time-limited recipe sets from now on. 

With the advent of the new date-locked events, it seems totally reasonable to offer the complete set of seasonal/event DIYs after the window ends. That way those who grind for them can show off their ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù items for a time, but those who don‚Äôt have that kind of time - or luck - don‚Äôt have to despair if they miss the window.

Case in Point: cherry blossoms. I was in the hospital that week and by the time I felt like playing I only got 1-2 of the recipes. My son has a SH island so I waited until October and ground every day on his island only to end up with just 1-2 more. They are some of my favorite looks. My life would be so much happier if I could have just bought the set from Nooks when it was over. 

This could apply for cherry blossoms (available for purchase beginning April/October 11), Bunny Day, spring bamboo, summer shells, maple leaves, mushrooms, Halloween, Turkey Day, snowflakes, ornaments/Toy Day... Make it available in Nooks for a decent fee the day after the date-locked event ends in game.

Not only will it make players happier and help minimize disappointment and frustration with spawn/drop rates, it *drastically* reduces the real-world market for hacked or farmed recipes."

Hi all!

I‚Äôm reaching out because I put my New Horizons down for several months, and I‚Äôm unfortunately experiencing major anxiety about picking it back up. As a kid, I could ignore my Animal Crossing village for months and get back into it without a blink of the eye, but as an adult (anxiety and mental health compounded on each other), it‚Äôs terrifying to me. 

I had decided to begin designing my village in earnest sometime in May, with plans to have a beach boardwalk, waterfalls, bamboo forests, and houses placed everywhere across the island. I packed my available QR design slots with flower patterns and white ‚ÄúThe Path‚Äù designs to sprinkle around the village. I knew I wasn‚Äôt nearly as creative and HGTV-savvy as some of my social media friends, but gosh dangit, I was going to do the damn thing!

And then...the fear and nervousness kicked in. Opening up my game to see a mess of an island, with my outdoor decor piled on one side of the museum while I had exactly one boardwalk finish, one waterfall area created, and two villagers moved. And it was starting to get colder, meaning my flower trails and summer food stands would be out-of-season. Meanwhile, I started to second-guess my hodgepodge of houses idea and then wanted a neat, sub-division of homes with equally-sized little yards all neat and measured. Then I began to have anxiety that my village square is a stone‚Äôs throw away from the airport, leaving me with very little space to make my square its own.  

All the while, I‚Äôm playing less and less as this anxiety compounds, and now it‚Äôs past Thanksgiving, and I‚Äôm terrified to open up the game. I‚Äôm terrified that my village will be awful, that I‚Äôll never achieve a beautiful place without outright stealing someone else‚Äôs village design theme, and I know that I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way about a fun, cute game that is supposed to be anything but stressful, but I can‚Äôt help it.

Not sure if I‚Äôm looking for advice, empathy, or just an ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, you can pick the game back up‚Äù. Just needed to unload for a minute."

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is part of the 6 nominees in the ""Game of the Year"" category. It also appears in two other categories ""Best Family"" and ""Best Multiplayer"".

Quoting their *About* page:

>**THE GAME AWARDS RECOGNIZES AND UPHOLDS CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE IN THE GLOBAL VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY.**  
>  
>We bring together a diverse group of game developers, game players, and notable names from popular culture to celebrate and advance gaming‚Äôs position as the most immersive, challenging and inspiring form of entertainment. We strive to recognize those who improve the wellbeing of the community and elevate voices that represent the future of the medium.

As for myself, I am an intense gamer that plays mostly competitive or skill-based game. I'm also mostly playing on PC. Let's say I'm not the Animal Crossing player stereotype, but I did play Animal Crossing: New Horizons this year though, moslty because my girlfriend is doing so. This game allow me to jump in her projects and spare some casual gaming time with her.

That being said, I may be mistaken, but The Game Awards is not the kind of event that attract the kind of people that play mostly casualy to games like Animal Crossing. No offense; forgive me if it is a false assumption. And that's the reason why I think such a post can make a difference.

# This game deserves our vote

Speaking of the ""Game of the Year"" category, I was looking at the listed games and couldn't imagine Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) to not win this part. Let me explain myself.

At first, we could think that ACNH is too casual and have no chance to compete against other giant franchises like *DOOM* or the masterpiece *Hades* that is a nominee in a total of 8 categories. The other nominees in this category may be *more fun*, may be *better designed* or may *persist in the years to come*, etc. But when I read ""Game of the Year"", I can't think of something else than the horrible 2020 year everyone of us had to go through. It is not needed to say how the global lockdown affect the year.

During the 2020 year, ACNH did a lot of things. Here's a quick list of things that stand out, IMO:

* This game allowed several people/couples/families to get through the lockdown.
* This game caused the Nintendo Switch to be missing everywhere for about 4 months.
* This game has [boosted Nintendo's financial numbers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356750/nintendo-earnings-q1-2020-switch-animal-crossing-sales).
* This game can literally acts as a place to meet virtually, when a meeting in real life is not possible.
* This game alone, accoring to Reddit's community sizes, is the biggest one out the 6 nominees. Of course, there's more context around it, but these numbers speak for themselves too: [Doom Eternal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doometernal/) (5.2k) - [The Last Of Us Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastOfUs2/) (39.1k) - [Final Fantasy UII Remake](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/) (81.9k) - [Hades](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/) (98.7k) - Ghost of [Tsushima](https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/) (123k) - [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossingNewHor/) (150k).
* This game alone also has multiple active reddit thread. (The rules forbid me to put links here)
* This game has a community that can share creations on social medias.
* This game released a FREE update that adds a lot of content every month since its launch.

Of course, some of these bullets can apply to some other games, but you get the idea. I'll repeat myself again, but IMO, ACNH is the game that marked the 2020 year the most and by far.

# Where to vote

This is quite simple actually. Just go on [this link](https://thegameawards.com/nominees), which is the voting page. Click on Animal Crossing: New Horizons to vote and sign in to do so. You don't even have to create an account since you need to log with either Twitter, Facebook or Google.

You also have one vote per category.

And thaaaat's it. My propaganda is done. I just wanted inform this community of The Game Awards event, and since this ACNH deserves the victory in my heart, I had to make such a post.

A huge thank you for reading. It's really appreciated.

\-Reelie

# TL;DR

The Game Awards is coming and I fear that Animal Crossing: New Horizons may be underrated by the gaming community. I believe that with the horrible 2020 year we all had, ACNH is the game that stands out the most in the ""Game of the Year"" category. It helped all of us to get through the year in many ways. If you want to vote for it, please do! It could make a difference."

Either way, all day yesterday we were trying to figure it out. But there was no Thanksgiving anything during the game. Just a normal game all day. As I understand it, this was a one day event which is now over. But I‚Äôd love to know if there is a step I should be doing for the next special update.
